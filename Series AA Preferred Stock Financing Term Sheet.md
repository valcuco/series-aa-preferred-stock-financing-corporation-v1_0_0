| Liquidation Preference:             
 -----------------------              | In the event of any liquidation or winding up of the Company, the holders of Series AA shall be entitled to receive in preference to the holders of the Common Stock a per share amount equal to the greater of: (i) the Original Purchase Price plus any declared but unpaid dividends or (ii) the amount such holder would have received had the shares of Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock immediately prior to the liquidation or winding up (the “**Liquidation Preference**”). After the payment of the Liquidation Preference to the holders of the Series AA, the remaining assets of the Company shall be distributed to the holders of the Common Stock on a pro-rata basis. A consolidation, merger, acquisition, sale of voting control or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company in which the stockholders of the Company do not own a majority of the outstanding shares of the surviving corporation shall be deemed to be a liquidation or winding up for purposes of the Liquidation Preference.
