    2.  **Preemptive Rights.**

        1.  **Preemptive Rights.** Subject to applicable securities laws, each Series AA Investor that is an accredited investor within the meaning of Regulation D of the Securities Act (an “***Accredited Investor***”) at the time of such proposed sale or issuance shall have a preemptive right to purchase up to its pro rata share of all Equity Securities, as defined below, that the Company may, from time to time, propose to sell and issue after the Closing Date applicable to such Series AA Investor, other than the Equity Securities excluded by Section 4(b)(vi) hereof. Each such Series AA Investor’s pro rata share is equal to the ratio of (a) the number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock (including all shares of Common Stock issuable or issued upon conversion of the Company’s Preferred Stock or upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options) of which such Series AA Investor is deemed to be a holder immediately prior to the issuance of the Equity Securities to (b) the total number of shares of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock (including all shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the Company’s Preferred Stock or upon the exercise of any outstanding warrants or options) immediately prior to the issuance of the Equity Securities. The term “***Equity Securities***” shall mean (i) any Common Stock, Preferred Stock or other security of the Company, (ii) any security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, with or without consideration, any Common Stock, Preferred Stock or other security of the Company (including any option to purchase such a convertible security), (iii) any security carrying any warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase any Common Stock, Preferred Stock or other security of the Company or (iv) any such warrant or right.

        2.  **Exercise of Rights.** If the Company proposes to issue any Equity Securities, it shall give each Series AA Investor written notice of its intention, describing the Equity Securities, the price and the terms and conditions upon which the Company proposes to issue the same. Each Series AA Investor shall have fifteen (15) days from the giving of such notice to agree to purchase up to its pro rata share of the Equity Securities for the price and upon the terms and conditions specified in the notice by giving written notice to the Company and stating therein the quantity of Equity Securities to be purchased. Such written notice given to the Company shall also include evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company that the Series AA Investor giving the notice will be an Accredited Investor at the time of consummation of the proposed sale. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to offer or sell such Equity Securities to any Series AA Investor who would cause the Company to be in violation of applicable state or federal securities laws by virtue of such offer or sale or who is not an Accredited Investor at the time of such sale.

        3.  **Sale Without Notice.** In lieu of giving notice to the Series AA Investors prior to the issuance of Equity Securities as provided in Section 4(b)(ii), the Company may elect to give notice to the Series AA Investors within thirty (30) days after the issuance of Equity Securities. Such notice shall describe the type, price and terms of the Equity Securities. Each Series AA Investor shall have twenty (20) days from the date of receipt of such notice to elect to purchase up to the number of shares that would, if purchased by such Series AA Investor, maintain such Series AA Investor’s pro rata share (as set forth in Section 4(b)(i)) of the Company’s equity securities after giving effect to all such purchases. Any election by a Series AA Investor to purchase Equity Securities pursuant to this Section 4(b)(iii) shall be accompanied by evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company that the Series AA Investor will be an Accredited Investor at the time of consummation of the proposed sale. The closing of such sale shall occur within sixty (60) days of the date of notice to the Series AA Investors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to offer or sell such Equity Securities to any Series AA Investor who would cause the Company to be in violation of applicable state or federal securities laws by virtue of such offer or sale or who is not an Accredited Investor at the time of such sale.

        4.  **Termination of Preemptive Rights.** The preemptive rights established by this Section 4(b) shall not apply to, and shall terminate upon the earlier of (A) the of closing of a Qualified IPO, as defined in the Charter, or (B) an Acquisition or Asset Transfer, each as defined in the Charter. In addition, the preemptive rights established by this Section 4(b) shall terminate upon the closing of a Qualified Financing (as defined below) and shall not apply to any Equity Securities offered by the Company after the closing of such Qualified Financing.

        5.  **Assignment of Preemptive Rights.** The preemptive rights of each Series AA Investor under this Section 4(b) may be assigned by a Series AA Investor to a transferee or assignee of Series AA Preferred that (A) is a subsidiary, parent, general partner, limited partner, retired partner, member or retired member, or stockholder of a Series AA Investor that is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company, (B) is a Series AA Investors’ family member or trust for the benefit of an individual Series AA Investor, or (C) acquires all of the Series AA Preferred held by such Series AA Investor; provided, however, (1) the transferor shall, within ten (10) days after such transfer, furnish to the Company written notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee, and (2) such transferee shall agree in writing to be subject to all restrictions set forth in this Agreement.
